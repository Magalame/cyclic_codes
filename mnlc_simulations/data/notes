for each n, get all the factors
get the degree of each factor, counting the multiplicity as + how many identical factors
use grey codes to check all combinations of factors degree, look for a combination s.t. degree = k
this would make use rely a lot more on flint, and less on rank computation
also decrease the number of trials

then for each g(x) created, we try all the f(x) possible (up to degree n - k - 1), and check for weight
